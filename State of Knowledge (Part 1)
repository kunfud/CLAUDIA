****PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT: MvP- v.3.0****
       State of Knowledge (Part 1)

       **Disclaimer: The product is in production and available for any marketplace**

****DESCRIPTION:****

CLAUDIA is a DAO, Decentralized Autonomous Organization, which takes all its governance under autonomous mechanisms on blockchain. It is under temporary protectorate of a Limited Liability Corporation with full ability to contract and establish legally binding obligation with any client in the world.

First clothes of CLAUDIA are the MvP we have developed as a blockchain-based web-app which integrates a survey and consulting application and applies the principles of privacy by design. Indeed, anonymization and pseudo-anonymization are available by default, and the client is the sole data owner of his/her opinions and consultations’ results. CLAUDIA, it enables the configuration of surveys with a maximum of four questions, which is a reasonable trade-off between optimal and objective attention and users ‘ongoing activity.  However it is up to the client how the client wants to manage the trade-off with its audience and how many questions the clients wants CLAUDIA to do in one shot.

Collective Intelligence is our service and CLAUDIA is our MvP for you to rise the voice anonymously and being rewarded for your fairness in your opinion. 


****OPERATIONAL SCALABLE MECHANISM:****

Through a very friendly and visual interface it is possible to configure and open consultations, to monitor the process while participation is allowed, and/or close the consultation. The panel allows to parameterize CLAUDIA with new questions and/or give the final results along with a blockchain certification on wudder layer within Azure and possibility of hybrid integrations throughout applications, processes and data with three minimal automated resources thru a GraphQL API to interact with HTTP API and a variety of SDKs for the strategic layer of CLAUDIA by using master token keys hash function MTK-512, which is a combination of BLAKE2b with 512-bit output and SHA3-512.

360 grades cognitive services such as processing, networking, storage, mobility database management, communication layer, information analysis and knowledge generation.
  
****USE CASES: EVENTS ´SUCCESS PoCs.****

One of the use cases are based on any kind of event, social event, professional event, open space or in a theatre for example. We have accomplished both with success and results are as following:

1.	SEMINCI 64, International Film Festival in Valladolid, Kigndom of Spain. October 2019
2.	CONVERGENCE 19, Global Blockchain Congress organized by Alastria, INATBA and European Blockchain Observatory and Forum, November 2019.
3.	CULTURGAL 2019, Pontevedra, Kingdom of Spain.

Within SEMINCI 64 CLAUDIA gave a reward for participating through a simple Smart Contract and one way usage QR Code, CLAUDIA would be able to anonymously provide feedback about the official program of the entire festival, and reward one of the participants with a VIP free entrance for next year at SEMINCI 65.

Within CONVERGENCE 19, the exploration was on the extensibility model of the product, we had maintained various meetings with interesting clients in Europe and South America and Caribbean Countries. With respect to technicalities we enhanced the capacity to adapt CLAUDIA in real time to the client´s requirements Consequently, CONVERGENCE 19 has provided an exercise to fuel CLAUDIA´s adaptability and capability. 

Within CULTURGAL 2019, the repetition of the experience with a mixed mechanism between the reward mechanism and the participation, proof of modeling was testing with success as well. Experience was dully accountable metrics for CLAUDIA´s MvP.

As a new interoperability pilot, in the context of the COP25, CLAUDIA was invited to join at a volunteer initiative, greenfilling initiative with the blockchain platform of ClimateTrade. Whereby CLAUDIA will help to calculate the Carbon footprint at the experimentation phase with XBRL, greenfilling initiative  will be driven focus on standardization and will serve to adapt CLAUDIA for global commercialization and promote tech-activism around Climate Change´s projects.
